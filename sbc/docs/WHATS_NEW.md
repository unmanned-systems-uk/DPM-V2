## 🎉 NEW ENHANCEMENTS

### 1. Enhanced CC_READ_THIS_FIRST.md

#### Added: Comprehensive Troubleshooting Section
**Location:** Near end of document (before Summary)

**New Content:**
- **Workflow Questions** - 6 common questions with detailed answers:
  - "I'm not sure what to work on next"
  - "I don't know if I should read a document"
  - "Should I ask permission to commit?"
  - "How much detail in commit messages?"
  - "Do I update docs before or after committing?"
  - "User instructions contradict these rules"

- **Technical Issues** - 5 common problems with solutions:
  - Git push failed (authentication, conflicts)
  - Docker container not running
  - Can't compile inside Docker
  - File not found in container
  - Camera not detected

- **Process Issues** - 4 workflow problems with solutions:
  - Made many changes without committing
  - Updated code but forgot docs
  - PROGRESS_AND_TODO.md has conflicts
  - Uncertain if this counts as "significant change"

**Benefits:**
- ✅ CC can self-diagnose common issues
- ✅ Reduces need for user intervention
- ✅ Clear decision guidelines for edge cases
- ✅ Technical troubleshooting steps included

#### Added: Visual Workflow Flowcharts
**Location:** Decision Tree section

**New Flowcharts:**
1. **Complete Session Workflow** - Full session from start to end
   - START → Read docs → Check git → Work → Commit → END
   - Shows decision points and loops
   - Clear mandatory vs optional steps

2. **Scenario A: Feature Completion** - Step-by-step for completed features
   - Test → Update docs → Stage → Commit → Push
   - Clear linear flow with all steps

3. **Scenario B: Bug Discovery** - Bug workflow from discovery to resolution
   - Investigate → Document → Commit note → Fix → Document fix → Commit
   - Shows two-phase process (document, then fix)

4. **Scenario C: End of Session** - Session ending procedure
   - Check completion → Update docs → Verify clean → Push
   - Decision tree for complete vs WIP commits

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Visual learners can understand workflow quickly
- ✅ Easy to follow step-by-step processes
- ✅ Shows decision points clearly
- ✅ Reduces ambiguity about "what comes next"

**Visual Example:**
```
╔═══════════════════════════════╗

╚═══════════════════════════════╝
            ↓
   Read CC_READ_THIS_FIRST.md
            ↓
   Read PROGRESS_AND_TODO.md
            ↓
      [Decision point]
         /        \
    Work      Reference docs
```

## 🎓 HOW TO USE NEW FEATURES

### Using Troubleshooting Section

**When you encounter an issue:**
1. Open CC_READ_THIS_FIRST.md
2. Search for keywords (Ctrl+F): "git push", "docker", "commit", etc.
3. Follow the solution steps
4. If solved → continue work
5. If not solved → escalate to user

**Example:**
```
Issue: "Git push failed"
Search: "git push" in CC_READ_THIS_FIRST.md
Find: Troubleshooting > Technical Issues > "Git push failed"
Follow: 4 solution steps with exact commands
Result: Issue resolved, continue work
```

### Using Visual Flowcharts

**When uncertain about workflow:**
1. Identify your situation:
   - Starting session? → Complete Session Workflow
   - Just finished feature? → Scenario A
   - Found a bug? → Scenario B
   - Ending session? → Scenario C

2. Follow the flowchart visually
3. Execute each step in order
4. Check decision points
5. Loop back if needed

**Example:**
```
Situation: "Just completed camera feature"
Use: Scenario A (Feature Completion) flowchart
Follow: Test → Update docs → Stage → Commit → Push
Result: Perfect commit with docs updated
```

### Using Copy-Paste Templates

**When updating PROGRESS_AND_TODO.md:**
1. Open PROGRESS_UPDATE_TEMPLATE.md
2. Find relevant template (1-7)
3. Copy entire template
4. Paste into PROGRESS_AND_TODO.md
5. Replace [bracketed] placeholders
6. Check usage checklist
7. Commit update

**Example:**
```
Task: "Document bug fix"
Template: #3 (Bug Resolution Update)
Copy: Entire template from file
Paste: Into PROGRESS_AND_TODO.md
Fill: [Bug Title], [Root cause], [Solution], etc.
Verify: Against 14-point checklist
Commit: With proper message
```
