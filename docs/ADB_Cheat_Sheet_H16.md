## üí° Pro Tips

### Multiple Devices

When you have both H16 and emulator connected:

```cmd
# Always specify device:
adb -s 10.0.1.92:5555 [command]
adb -s emulator-5554 [command]

# Or set environment variable:
set ANDROID_SERIAL=10.0.1.92:5555
# Now all adb commands target H16 by default
```

### Alias for Quick Access

Create shortcuts in your shell:

```cmd
# In PowerShell profile:
function h16 { adb -s 10.0.1.92:5555 $args }

# Now use:
h16 install app-debug.apk
h16 logcat
h16 shell
```

### Save Frequent Commands

Create `.bat` files for your most-used command sequences and keep them in your project root.
