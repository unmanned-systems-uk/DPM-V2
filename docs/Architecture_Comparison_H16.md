**Option 1: Complete Migration to H16**
- Sell/repurpose tablet and generic link
- Purchase H16 system
- Adapt Android app to H16
- **Best long-term solution**

**Option 2: Hybrid Approach**
- Keep tablet as backup/secondary GCS
- Add H16 as primary GCS
- App works on both
- **Maximum flexibility**

**Option 3: Gradual Transition**
- Start development on tablet/emulator
- Test with generic network
- Later add H16 when ready
- Minimal code changes needed
- **Lowest risk approach**

## Development Strategy Recommendation

### Phase 1 Development Path:

**Weeks 1-6: Core Development (Platform-Agnostic)**
- Develop Pi service
- Design network protocol
- Create Android app
- **Can test on emulator or tablet**
- Network communication is same

**Weeks 7-10: Android App (Tablet or Emulator)**
- UI development
- Camera controls
- Status display
- **Works on any Android device**

**Weeks 11-15: System Integration**
- If you have H16: deploy to H16
- If not yet: continue tablet testing
- **Easy transition when H16 arrives**

**Week 16+: H16 Optimization**
- Optimize UI for H16 7" display
- Integrate with H16 physical buttons (if desired)
- Test wireless link range/performance
- **Polish for professional deployment**

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Network Protocol (Same for Both)
The TCP/UDP protocol we design will work identically on:
- Tablet connected via generic data-link
- H16 connected via R16 digital link
- Android emulator on development PC

**No code changes needed when switching platforms!**

### Android App Compatibility
```kotlin
// App works the same way regardless of platform
class NetworkClient(
    private val serverIp: String = "192.168.144.20", // Configurable
    private val tcpPort: Int = 5000,
    private val udpPort: Int = 5001
) {
    // Implementation is identical for tablet or H16
    // Only configuration changes (IP address, if needed)
}
```

### Deployment Flexibility
```bash
# Deploy to any Android device:
adb install payload_manager.apk

# Works on:
- Android emulator (development)
- Consumer tablet (testing)
- H16 Ground Station (production)
```

2. ‚úÖ **Similar/lower cost** - Comparable to good tablet setup
3. ‚úÖ **Better performance** - Lower latency, more reliable
4. ‚úÖ **Professional appearance** - Purpose-built GCS
5. ‚úÖ **Future-proof** - Industry-standard platform
6. ‚úÖ **Flexible development** - Can test on emulator/tablet first
7. ‚úÖ **Easy transition** - Minimal code changes when H16 arrives

### Development Plan:
1. **Now:** Develop Pi service + Android app (test on emulator)
2. **Early testing:** Use tablet if available (optional)
3. **Final deployment:** Deploy to H16 when ready
4. **Result:** Professional system, smooth transition
