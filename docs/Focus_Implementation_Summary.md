## Testing Instructions

### Air-Side Testing (Ready Now)

**Prerequisites:**
- Sony camera connected via USB
- Payload-manager container running: `payload-manager:latest`
- Camera in manual focus mode

**Test Commands:**

1. **Start focusing near:**
```bash
echo '{"seq_id":1,"command":"camera.focus","payload":{"action":"near","speed":3}}' | \
  nc -w 2 localhost 5000
```

2. **Stop focusing:**
```bash
echo '{"seq_id":2,"command":"camera.focus","payload":{"action":"stop"}}' | \
  nc -w 2 localhost 5000
```

3. **Trigger auto-focus:**
```bash
# Press
echo '{"seq_id":3,"command":"camera.auto_focus_hold","payload":{"state":"press"}}' | \
  nc -w 2 localhost 5000

# Release (after 1 sec)
echo '{"seq_id":4,"command":"camera.auto_focus_hold","payload":{"state":"release"}}' | \
  nc -w 2 localhost 5000
```

### Ground-Side Testing (After Implementation)

See `/docs/Ground_Side_Focus_Implementation_Guide.md` Section 6: Testing Strategy

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Focus Speed Control:**
   - Speed parameter (1-3) accepted but not applied
   - Sony SDK v2.00 doesn't expose `CrDeviceProperty_Focus_Driving_Speed`
   - Camera uses default/hardware speed
   - Future SDK versions may enable this

2. **Focus Position Feedback:**
   - Current implementation doesn't return focus position value
   - Property exists: `CrDeviceProperty_FocusPositionCurrentValue`
   - Future enhancement for focus position slider UI

3. **Focus Mode Dependency:**
   - Manual focus (near/far) requires camera in MF mode
   - Auto-focus hold works in AF-S/AF-C modes
   - Ground-Side UI should detect and adapt to current mode

### Performance Notes

- **Command Rate:** Max 10 commands/second recommended
- **Latency:** 50-200ms typical over WiFi
- **Battery Impact:** Continuous manual focus increases power consumption

## Next Steps

### For Air-Side Team:
1. ✅ **COMPLETE** - All Air-Side work is done
2. Monitor for any issues during Ground-Side integration
3. Consider future enhancements:
   - Focus position reading
   - Focus speed control (when SDK supports it)
   - Focus peaking indicator

### For Ground-Side Team:
1. **Read** `/docs/Ground_Side_Focus_Implementation_Guide.md` thoroughly
2. **Phase 1** - Implement protocol client methods (Week 1)
3. **Phase 2** - Implement ViewModel and state management (Week 1-2)
4. **Phase 3** - Build UI components (Week 2)
5. **Phase 4** - Integration testing with real hardware (Week 2-3)
6. **Phase 5** - Polish and field testing (Week 3)

### For QA Team:
1. Review test scenarios in implementation guide
2. Prepare test hardware: Sony camera + Raspberry Pi + Android device
3. Create test plan based on provided test cases
4. Schedule field testing session with drone
